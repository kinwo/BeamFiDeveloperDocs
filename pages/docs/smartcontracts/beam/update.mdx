## Stop Beam

Once a beam is created, it can be stopped by the sender which is the one who deposit the tokens for streaming to recipient.

```js
public shared ({ caller }) func stopBeam(escrowId : EscrowId) : async Result<BeamStatus, ErrorCode>
```

## Restart Beam

Similarlly, when a beam is stopped, it can only be restarted by the sender.

```js
public shared ({ caller }) func restartBeam(escrowId : EscrowId) : async Result<BeamStatus, ErrorCode>
```
