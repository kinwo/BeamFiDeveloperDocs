# Claim tokens as receipient

To claim tokens as receipient, you need to call the `creatorClaimByPrincipal` function on the BeamEscrow service canister using the receipient's identity principal and the Escrow ID you get from createBeamEscrow or queryMyBeams.

```js
public shared ({ caller }) func creatorClaimByPrincipal(
  escrowId : EscrowId,
  tokenType : TokenType,
  creatorPrinciapl : Principal
) : async Result<Text, EscrowType.ErrorCode>
```

Switch to the receipient1 identity in dfx:

```bash
dfx identity use receipient1
```

Run the following in command line to claim tokens:

```bash
dfx canister call beamescrow creatorClaimByPrincipal "(0, variant { icp }, principal \"om674-h2bcd-bhoxu-2deg5-lqfv5-w7kea-oqsa2-rhtqu-o5jih-5xfc7-qae\")"
```

Check your ICP balance:

```bash
dfx ledger balance --ledger-canister-id $(dfx canister id ledger)
```

It should return an arbitary number of ICP not 10 ICP because the ICP tokens is still being streamed to the receipient1 identity.

To check the streaming status of the receipient1 identity, use [Beam queryBeamByEscrowIds](/docs/smartcontracts/beam/query).
