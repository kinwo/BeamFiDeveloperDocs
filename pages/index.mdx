Welcome to BeamFi Protocol Developer Documentation!

BeamFi is a decentralized DeFi protocol for micro payments running on [Dfinity Internet Computer](https://internetcomputer.org) blockchain.
It allows users to send or receive a constant stream of micro payments.

It makes real-time money streaming possible by using the native feature of blockchain:

- transfer of value
- self-custody of assets through autonomous Beam smart contracts
